# My Portfolio

> The Portfolio project, basically a figma template where we applied some javascript with my programming partners of this week.

This project is built with various sections, the "Header" "Headline", e.tc.  `The mobile Menu` is in the header section of the mobile version, which includes the logo, and navbar, and background templates. All elements (background and icons, logo) were exported from Figma phototypes. Also, I parse a Figma design to create a UI. In the form, the data is collected by using `Formspree service(https://formspree.io/html)`.
